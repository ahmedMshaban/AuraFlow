## focus tab vs others tab

### Focused Emails (High Priority/Immediate Attention)
- Starred emails (user explicitly marked as important)
- Unread important emails from personal category (CATEGORY_PERSONAL + IMPORTANT + UNREAD)
- Unread emails from known contacts (not promotional)
- Recent emails marked as important (within last 24-48 hours)

### Other Emails (Lower Priority/Background Processing)
Promotional emails (CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS) - regardless of importance
Social media notifications (CATEGORY_SOCIAL)
Updates and newsletters (CATEGORY_UPDATES)
Forum emails (CATEGORY_FORUMS)
Read important emails (already processed)
## notes

- Currently, we only have read-only access to Gmail, so the "mark as read" feature is unavailable.
